# Cloud-Monitoring-App
My first DevOps Project

This Cloud Native DevOps project involves the creation of a real-time Python monitoring application using Flask and the utilization of various DevOps tools, including AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and more. 

The objective of this project is to:
1. Create Python Monitoring Application:
    Develop a Python application using Flask from scratch for real-time monitoring.
   
3. Local Application Deployment:
    Run the Python application locally on port 5000 for testing and development purposes.
   
4. Containerization with Docker:
    Containerize the Python application using Docker, ensuring it can run consistently across different environments.
5. Dockerfile Creation:
    Write a Dockerfile to define the application's dependencies and configuration.
   
6. Docker Image Build:
    Build a Docker image from the Dockerfile, which encapsulates the application and its environment.
   
7. Docker Container Deployment:
    Deploy a Docker container from the previously built Docker image, enabling the application to run within the container.

8. ECR Image Repository:
    Create an Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store and manage Docker images.

9. EKS Cluster and Nodes:
    Set up an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with worker nodes to orchestrate containerized applications.

10. Kubernetes Deployment and Service:
    Create Kubernetes Deployments and Services using Python, defining how the application should run and be accessed within the cluster.

11. Port Forwarding and Exposing the Application:
    Implement port forwarding and expose the Kubernetes application, making it accessible to external users.
